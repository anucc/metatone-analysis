# Metatone Analysis Project

We're going to use transition matrices to analyse ALL of the metatone performances! It will be rad.

None of the original data is in the repo, you'll need to grab the -touch.csv files and drop them in `data` for the system to work properly.

Run `metatone_post_hoc_analysis.py` to generate all of the other data.

## Important files:

The output data file is the important one: `metatone-performance-data.csv`. Import this into R and ANOVA for great good.
